# AutoImageCaptioning
 The project is aimed at generating high-quality captions for images by using a combination of convolutiona l neural networks (convnets) to obtain the vectorial representation of images and recurrent neural networks (RNN) combined with visual attention mechanisms to decode those representations into natural language sentences that describe the image.
